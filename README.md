# POC: Appointments with Vonage AI

A proof of concept using Vonage AI for appointments.

## Firebase (BaaS)

It relies on Firebase as backend even for local development,
so we have a vendor lock-in, but that's fine for a quick POC.
Get ready to
[press some buttons here](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/99/9903c7c14add3fd0758b7b5b80c24d48101f296f13ce34736799a82c71f61bc2.jpg).
But don't worry, all sensitive details are automated, you're just initializing the resources.

So open https://console.firebase.google.com/ and create a Project.
No need to enable Analytics.

First, enable the database, look for a "Cloud Firestore" section and create it.
Select the "test mode" while creating it for now.

Now, for the credentials. Look for a button that sounds like "Add Firebase to your web app",
it's a wizard to generate your credentials.

By the way, if you're concerned with remote deploys,
mark "Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app."

Stop when you see a config JSON, you'll need it for the next step.

## Local setup (Node)

Using **Node 18**, just install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

Create a safe environment variables for you called `.env` using the `sample.env`:

```sh
cp sample.env .env
```

Fill it with the data you gathered earlier in the Firebase step.

And run the app:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Deploying it (PaaS)

Just for clarifications, we'll need from this Cloud:

- Firestore
- Functions
- Hosting

TLDR, the commands are:

```sh
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase deploy
```

If you're maintaining a custom instance (made by someone else than the original repo author),
you'll probably need to somehow override the project name used as target.

## Licensing

This is proprietary software made by WebRTC.ventures & AgilityFeat and written by
their favorite developer Marcell da Silva (Mazuh).
